# Scalable programming with Scala and Spark [Video]
This is the code repository for [Scalable programming with Scala and Spark [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/scalable-programming-scala-and-spark-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Get your data to fly using Spark and Scala for analytics, machine learning, and data science. Letâ€™s parse that. What's Spark? If you are an analyst or a data scientist, you're used to having multiple systems for working with data. SQL, Python, R, Java, etc. With Spark, you have a single engine where you can explore and play with large amounts of data, run machine learning algorithms and then use the same system to productionize your code. Scala: Scala is a general-purpose programming language - like Java or C++. Its functional programming nature and the availability of a REPL environment make it particularly suited for a distributed computing framework like Spark.

Analytics: Using Spark and Scala you can analyze and explore your data in an interactive environment with fast feedback. The course will show how to leverage the power of RDDs and Dataframes to manipulate data with ease.

Machine Learning and Data Science: Spark's core functionality and built-in libraries make it easy to implement complex algorithms like Recommendations with very few lines of code. We'll cover a variety of datasets and algorithms including PageRank, MapReduce and Graph datasets.
